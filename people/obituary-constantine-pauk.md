In memoriam  of Mr. Constantine Pauk, a brilliant mind and a dedicated professional. Mr. Pauk was the Vice President for Public Affairs  and a valuable member of our team. He was born on August 14th, 1986 in Taganrog, Russia, and departed from this world on March 21st, 2023 in Prague, Czech Republic.

Mr. Pauk was a graduate of the Southern Federal University, where he received both his undergraduate and graduate training. He had over 13 years of experience in software development, inventory management, and new product introduction processes. He was an expert in his field, and his work had a significant impact on the operations of our organization.

Throughout his career, Mr. Pauk held many critical roles at renowned IT companies, where he worked on outsourcing and procurement projects in Russia, Belarus, Thailand, and Ukraine. He also implemented quality systems in both small and large projects. His passion for helping local businesses establish and increase their online presence was truly inspiring.

Outside of work, Mr. Pauk was a voracious reader and outdoor enthusiast. He enjoyed spending time in nature and participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) hacking challenges.

Mr. Pauk's life shone bright, and it is with deep sadness that we say goodbye to him so early. He will be remembered for his kindness, intelligence, and unwavering dedication to his work. Our thoughts and condolences go out to his parents and sister during this difficult time.

> Выгораю на солнце, рвусь на части -\
> Одинок и холост, но в принципе счастлив.\
> Не понимаю зачем я и что меня держит\
> Одной ногой в земле, во мне есть стержень.\
> Вокруг суета и шум серьезные лица,\
> Люблю свободный полет но не люблю птиц я.\
> И несмотря на страх и смену режимов\
> Просто в своих руках сильней держи меня.\
> Все что мне остается , это смотреть на горизонт\
> Туда, где прячется солнце, быть может там мой дом.\
